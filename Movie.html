    <h1>My Favourite Movie</h1>
    <h2>Ponniyin Selvan</h2>
    <img src="PS1.jpeg" alt="movie poster image">
    <p>Ponniyin Selvan is about the battle for succession in the Chola kingdom. At the beginning of the story, a comet appears in the sky. This is interpreted as a sign that someone from the royal family will die. Since Sundara Chola has been ill for years, it is assumed that he will pass away soon. <br/><br/>

      Aditha Karikalan should succeed Sundara Chola but the crown prince, while celebrated for his valour in battle, is also known for his erratic behaviour. His younger brother, Arulmozhi Varman, is the people’s favourite. Princess Kundavai, who is known for her astute reading of politics, also believes that Arulmozhi will become a great emperor. She is grooming the shy princess Vanathi of the Kodumbalur clan to marry Arulmozhi.<br/><br/>
      
      Madurantakan, who is uncle to Sundara Chola’s children but closer to them in age, is married to Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar’s daughter. The Pazhuvettaraiyars prefer him to succeed Sundara Chola since that will give them even greater power. There are other allies of the Cholas who also conspire with the Pazhuvettaraiyars over this. <br/><br/>
      
      Meanwhile, the Pandyas are thirsting for revenge. Their king, Veerapandiyan, was killed by Aditha Karikalan, and they have sworn to avenge his death. They are waiting for a golden opportunity to destroy the Chola dynasty. </p>
